# Sequential-games
Software complex focused on modelling sequential games

Field: Operations research -> Game Theory -> Sequential Games -> Extension of basic theory

Purpose: design and analyze sequential behavioural models

Progress: alpha version presented as bachelors thesis and successfully defended.

Comments: this project is far away from the goal, but the tree redactor is quite nice and the game theory involved is ok.
